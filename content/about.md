A collection of the hilarious (and often poetic) musings and exclamations of [Vic Rauter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Rauter). Every post on this site is a direct quotation from Vic during a curling broadcast.

It started as a dream — a coffee table book featuring full-page images of great moments in curling accompanied by whatever Vic said during the TSN broadcast at the time. Instead we have this blog.
