Yes, MakeTheFinal.ca has an API! (I know, finally, right?) 

The full body of content is available in JSON format, found at `https://makethefinal.ca/posts/data.json`.

Additionally, each post can be pulled individually from its own URL: `https://makethefinal.ca/posts/<POST-ID>/data.json`.

Have fun!

## Data Format:

```json
{
"count" : 167,
"date" : "2022-01-17T15:48:00-05:00",
"posts" : [
	{
    "title" : "If you want to be better, youâ€™ve got to get as good as they are",
    "date" : "2013-03-10T23:07:00-05:00",
