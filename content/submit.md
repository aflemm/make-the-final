Did you hear Vic say something hilarious? It could be from a current game or archival footage. Send me a submission using the form below, and I will post it to the site.

Be sure to provide me as much context for when Vic said this, I won't post anything I cannot verify in the recorded broadcast.

When you make a submission, I would like to attribute the post to you. If you agree, I'll add your name and optionally a link to your twitter/instagram/etc. to the published post.

Thanks! ðŸ˜ƒ
